# At your Service!

## Introduction
This is a solution to an existing problem in the local community of Windsor to the educational institutes. Every year there are plenty of students who apply to various universities and colleges all over the world, they face numerous difficulties in gaining information for their desired programs. As the university officials cannot be present to answer the queries 24/7, especially for the international students, bearing in mind the time difference we built a chatbot using DialogFlow that could resolve the queries any time anywhere.  

## Link of the Project  
Below is the link to access and use the chatbot, it is freely accessible by anyone:

## Code for data scraping  

The ipynb file contains the code that we built to scrape the data needed for creating the queries and responses in the intents.  
This is a snippet of the code we used to scrape other elements of the data too. As this code is dynamic, we used the same logic to scrape other elements just like we did with the column "Specialization" mentioned in the file solution-challenge-2020-scraping.csv
